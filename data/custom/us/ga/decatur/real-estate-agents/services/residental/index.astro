                    <h2>What Is Residential Real Estate?</h2><p>
                        Residential real estate refers to properties designed
                        for people to live in, such as single-family homes,
                        townhouses, condos, and apartments. These properties are
                        often a major investment, and choosing the right one is
                        crucial for both comfort and financial security.
